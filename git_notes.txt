Git allows you to precisely track revisions to files.
You must first establish a git repository to keep track of the various revisions.
You add files to the Git repository by staging them using the "git add" command. This tells Git to pay attention to these files and track when they have been modified.
When you modify a tracked file, you need to manually re-stage it every time to make sure that all your changes get reflected in the Git repository. This is an hour-by-hour type of update.
When you have completed your various changes, you commit them by using the "git commit" command. Be sure to include a message to explain is included in your latest commit. This is a bigger change and is not done as often as staging.
